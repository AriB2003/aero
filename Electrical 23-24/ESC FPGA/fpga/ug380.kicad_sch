  (text "Page 48\nOne of the following system design approaches can ensure that the SPI flash is ready to \nreceive commands before the FPGA starts its configuration procedure:\n• Control the sequence of the power supplies such that the SPI flash is certain to be \npowered and ready for asynchronous reads before the FPGA begins its configuration \nprocedure.\n• Hold the FPGA PROGRAM_B pin Low from power-up to delay the start of the FPGA \nconfiguration procedure and release the PROGRAM_B pin to High after the SPI flash \nis fully powered and is able to receive commands.\n• Hold the FPGA INIT_B pin Low from power-up to delay the start of the FPGA \nconfiguration procedure and release the INIT_B pin to High after the SPI flash \nbecomes ready to receive commands"

This downloads a new FPGA design that \nprovides a connection from the iMPACT software through the Spartan-6 device to the SPI \nflash. Previous FPGA memory contents are lost. For a list of supported SPI flash devices in \nthe latest version of software, see Introduction to Indirect Programming - SPI or BPI Flash \nMemory."
