  (text "Page 62\nTo ensure proper power-on behavior, the guidelines in the Spartan-6 FPGA Data Sheet: DC \nand Switching Characteristics must be followed. The power supplies should ramp \nmonotonically within the power supply ramp time range specified. All supply voltages \nshould be within the recommended operating ranges; any dips in VCCINT below VDRINT or \nVCCAUX below VDRAUX can result in loss of configuration data.\nVCCO_2 and sometimes VCCO_1 determine the I/O voltage for the configuration \ninterface (SPI, Serial, BPI, and SelectMAP). VCCAUX determines the I/O voltage for the \nJTAG configuration pins. The voltage provided must be compatible with all configuration \ninterfaces that will be used"

  (text "1. See Table 5-2, page 74 for internal pin terminations and pins affected by HSWAPEN.\n2. DOUT should be connected to the DIN of the downstream FPGA for daisy-chained \nconfiguration modes.\n3. For more details on CCLK termination, see Board Layout for Configuration Clock \n(CCLK), page 56.\n4. A series resistor should be considered for the datapath from the flash to the FPGA to \nminimize overshoot. The proper resistor value can be determined from simulation.\n5. The Spartan-6 FPGA VCCO_2 supply must be the same voltage as VCC of the SPI \ndevice.\n6. CSO_B and MOSI are clocked by the CCLK falling edge.\n7. DIN is clocked on the rising edge of the CCLK.\n8. There are additional pins on the SPI flash side, such as Write Protect and Hold. These \npins are not used in FPGA configuration (read only). But they should be tied off \nappropriately according to the SPI vendor’s specification. \n9. If HSWAPEN is left unconnected or tied High, a pull-up resistor is required for CSO_B.\n10. The CCLK frequency is adjusted by using the BitGen option ConfigRate if the source \nis the internal oscillator. If an external source is used, see External Configuration Clock \nfor Master Modes, page 56 for more details.\n11. The DONE pin is by default an open-drain output with an internal pull-up. An \nadditional external pull-up is recommended in general, but required when using the \nindirect programming method using iMPACT. The DONE pin has a programmable \nactive driver that can be enabled via the BitGen option -g DriveDone.\n12. When the digital clock manager (DCM) or PLL lock wait is enabled before the DONE \nrelease cycle during startup, the FPGA continues to clock in data until the startup wait \ncondition is met and DONE is released. See Required Data Spacing between MultiBoot \nImages, page 138 for considerations specific to MultiBoot Configuration.\n13. Figure 2-12 shows an example SPI flash device. Refer to the ISE software overview at \nhttp://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx14_7/isehelp_start.htm\nand navigate to the iMPACT help documentation (“Introduction to Indirect \nProgramming”) to see which devices are supported for indirect SPI configuration \nusing iMPACT.\n14. VFS is present in 6SLX75/T, 6SLX100/T, and 6SLX150/T devices, and is used for \neFUSE programming. See eFUSE, page 93 for more details.\n15. VBATT is present in 6SLX75/T, 6SLX100/T, and 6SLX150/T devices, and is the power \nsource for AES key storage. If AES encryption is unused, VBATT can be tied to either \nVCCAUX or ground, or left unconnected.\n16. If VCCO_2 is 1.8V, VCCAUX must be 2.5V. If VCCO_2 is 2.5V or 3.3V, VCCAUX can be \neither 2.5V or 3.3V.\n17. The SUSPEND pin should be Low during power up and configuration. If the Suspend \nfeature is not used, the SUSPEND pin must be connected to ground."
